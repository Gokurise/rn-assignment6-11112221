For the Design and Storage I used 'AsyncStorage'.

 I used AsyncStorage because it persists data. It provides a simple key-value system that works well for persisting small amounts of data such as user preferences and settings.
 AsyncStorage also modularize data access by creating a dedicated storage utility.

 How I Implemented My AsyncStorage:

 Firstly, I installed the ' @react-native-async-storage/async-storage' package.(npm install @react-native-async-storage/async-storage)

 Secondly, I created a storage utility module(storage.js) to encapsulate the data storage logic.

 Thirdly, I integrated the storage utility functions within my React Native components to store and restore data.
